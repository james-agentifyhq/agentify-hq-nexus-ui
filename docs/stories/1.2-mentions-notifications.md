# Story 1.2: @Mentions and Notification System

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** workspace member,
**I want** to mention other users with @username and receive notifications,
**so that** I can get teammates' attention and stay informed of relevant messages.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I'm composing a message, **when** I type "@" followed by a username, **then** I see an autocomplete dropdown of workspace members

2. **Given** a message with @mention, **when** it's sent, **then** the mentioned user receives a real-time notification

3. **Given** I'm mentioned in a channel, **when** I view notifications, **then** I see the message preview, sender, and channel context

4. **Given** notification preferences, **when** I customize settings, **then** I can control @mention notifications per channel and globally

5. **Given** unread mentions, **when** I navigate the workspace, **then** I see a badge count on channels with unread mentions

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

**TDD Workflow (MANDATORY)**:
- **Red Phase**: Write tests FIRST for each task before any implementation
- **Green Phase**: Implement minimum code to pass tests
- **Refactor Phase**: Improve code quality while tests ensure nothing breaks
- **Order**: Tests → Failing tests → Implementation → Passing tests → Refactor

**Test Commands**:
- `npm run test:watch` - Auto-run tests on file save (recommended during development)
- `npm run test` - Run all unit tests (Vitest)
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run E2E tests (Playwright)
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage report (minimum 80% for new code)

**Test Structure**:
- Unit tests location: `tests/unit/`
- E2E tests location: `tests/e2e/`
- Test naming: `{feature}.test.ts` or `{feature}.spec.ts`
- Use Given-When-Then format in test descriptions
- Map each AC to specific tests

**Quality Standards**:
- Each AC must have corresponding unit and/or E2E tests
- Coverage minimum: 80% for new code
- Follow `docs/testing-strategy.md` for complete TDD/BDD guidelines

### Relevant Architecture

**Tech Stack**:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript
- Backend: Convex (serverless backend with real-time subscriptions)
- UI: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives), Tailwind CSS
- Rich Text: Quill editor for message composition
- State: Jotai for global state management

**Project Structure**:
- Feature modules: `/src/features/{feature}/`
- API hooks: `/src/features/{feature}/api/use-{action}-{entity}.ts`
- Backend functions: `/convex/{entity}.ts`
- Shared components: `/src/components/`
- UI primitives: `/src/components/ui/`

**Convex Patterns**:
- Define schema in `convex/schema.ts` using `defineTable` and validators
- Use `query()` for reads, `mutation()` for writes
- Create indexes for optimized queries: `.index('by_{field}', ['{field}'])`
- Access database via `ctx.db` in handler functions
- Use `v` from `convex/values` for type validators

**Frontend Hook Pattern**:
- Wrap Convex mutations with consistent API: `{ mutate, isPending, isSuccess, isError }`
- Support callbacks: `onSuccess`, `onError`, `onSettled`
- Use path aliases: `@/*` imports from `/src`
- Follow existing patterns in `/src/features/messages/api/` for reference

**Real-time Updates**:
- Convex provides automatic real-time subscriptions
- Use `useQuery` for reactive data
- Mutations trigger automatic re-queries
- No manual WebSocket management needed

### Related Files from Story 1.1

**Completed in Story 1.1**:
- `convex/schema.ts` - Extended with `userProfiles` table (userType: human|ai-agent)
- `convex/users.ts` - Added `getUserType` and `isHumanUser` helper queries
- Schema indexes created: `by_user_id` on userProfiles

**Patterns to Follow**:
- Additive-only schema changes (no breaking modifications)
- Backward compatibility with default values
- Helper query functions for common lookups
- Index creation for performance optimization

### Integration Requirements

**Story 1.1 Dependencies**:
- User type system (`userType` field) is available for filtering human vs bot users
- Use `isHumanUser` query to filter autocomplete results (only show human users for now)
- Future-proof: Notification system will work for bot mentions in Phase 2

**Existing Features to Preserve**:
- Message creation/editing flows must continue working
- Real-time message delivery (<500ms) must be maintained
- Thread/reply functionality should integrate with mentions
- Image message uploads should work alongside @mentions

**Performance Considerations**:
- Index all foreign keys (userId, messageId, channelId) for fast lookups
- Use Convex pagination for notification lists
- Debounce autocomplete search queries
- Batch notification creation for multiple mentions in one message
