# Phase 1: Production-Ready Human Collaboration Platform - PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source:** IDE-based fresh analysis of codebase + UI screenshot review (September 2025)

#### Current Project State

The existing project is a **full-featured Slack clone** built with Next.js 14 and Convex serverless backend. The application provides real-time workspace collaboration with the following core capabilities:

- **Multi-workspace architecture**: Users can create and join multiple workspaces using secure join codes
- **Communication channels**: Public channels and private direct messages with threading support
- **Rich messaging**: Text formatting (bold, italic, strikethrough), emoji reactions, image uploads, message editing/deletion
- **User management**: OAuth authentication (Google, GitHub) and email/password, with workspace roles (admin/member)
- **Real-time synchronization**: Convex backend provides automatic live updates across all connected clients
- **Modern UI**: Slack-like interface with sidebar navigation, workspace switcher, threads/drafts section, and activity tracking

The codebase follows a feature-based architecture with clear separation between frontend (Next.js App Router) and backend (Convex functions), using TypeScript throughout for type safety.

### Available Documentation Analysis

**Using existing project analysis from codebase inspection.**

**Available Documentation:**
- ‚úÖ Tech Stack Documentation (CLAUDE.md - comprehensive architecture overview)
- ‚úÖ Source Tree/Architecture (well-organized feature modules in `/src/features`)
- ‚úÖ API Documentation (Convex backend functions with validators)
- ‚úÖ External API Documentation (Convex auth, storage patterns documented)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Coding Standards (implicit through consistent patterns, not formalized)
- ‚ùå UX/UI Guidelines (not documented)
- ‚ùå Technical Debt Documentation (not documented)

**Recommendation**: The existing CLAUDE.md provides strong technical foundation. For Phase 1, we should formalize coding standards, document UX/UI guidelines, and track technical debt.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:**
- ‚úÖ **Bug Fix and Stability Improvements** (production-readiness)
- ‚úÖ **New Feature Addition** (missing H2H collaboration features)
- ‚úÖ **Performance/Scalability Improvements** (optimize existing features)
- ‚úÖ **UI/UX Enhancement** (polish and consistency)
- üîÆ **Future-Proofing** (prepare for Phase 2 bot integration)

**Enhancement Description:**

Transform the current Slack clone prototype into a **production-ready human-to-human collaboration platform**. This phase focuses on solidifying existing features, fixing bugs, adding missing collaboration capabilities, and establishing a robust foundation for future AI agent integration (Phase 2).

**Impact Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ **Moderate Impact** (refinements and additions to existing code)
- üîÆ **Future-Ready** (data model and API design prepare for bot users)

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals

**Phase 1 (Current Focus):**
- Achieve production-ready stability and performance for H2H collaboration
- Complete missing Slack-like features (mentions, notifications, search, file sharing)
- Establish solid UX/UI guidelines and accessibility standards
- Prepare data model and APIs for future bot/agent integration
- Document technical debt and create improvement roadmap

**Future Phases (Reference Only):**
- Phase 2: Remote bot integration (Google Cloud Agent Engine + google-adk)
- Phase 3: MCP registry and A2A protocol integration
- Phase 4: Dev/Work mode toggle and local sandbox support

#### Background Context

The current Slack clone provides core collaboration features but lacks the polish, performance, and completeness required for production deployment. Phase 1 addresses these gaps while strategically preparing the platform for AI agent integration.

**Key Strategic Decision**: Future AI agents will be treated as **users with special type** (`userType: 'ai-agent'`) rather than a separate system. This means our user management, permissions, and interaction patterns must be extensible from the start.

**Agile Approach**: Each phase will have its own PRD. This document focuses exclusively on achieving production-ready H2H collaboration.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript
**Frameworks**: Next.js 14.2.7 (App Router), React 18, Tailwind CSS
**Database**: Convex (serverless backend with real-time subscriptions)
**Authentication**: @convex-dev/auth (Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth, email/password)
**UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
**State Management**: Jotai
**Rich Text**: Quill editor
**Infrastructure**: Vercel (frontend), Convex Cloud (backend)
**External Dependencies**: Convex Storage for file uploads

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy:**
- Extend Convex schema with new tables for notifications, bookmarks, pins, file metadata
- Add `userType` field to users table (default: 'human', future: 'ai-agent')
- Create `agents` table for future Phase 2 (initially empty, no migrations needed)
- Use Convex indexes for search optimization and query performance

**API Integration Strategy:**
- Expand existing Convex mutations/queries following current patterns
- Maintain feature-based API organization (`/src/features/*/api/use-*.ts`)
- Implement webhook infrastructure for future bot event handling
- Design message API to support both synchronous (human) and async (bot) patterns

**Frontend Integration Strategy:**
- Build new features using existing shadcn/ui components
- Follow App Router patterns with server/client component separation
- Extend existing Jotai atoms for global state (notifications, search, presence)
- Maintain consistent URL structure and routing conventions

**Testing Integration Strategy:**
- Add unit tests for new Convex functions (Jest)
- Implement E2E tests for critical user flows (Playwright recommended)
- Use Convex's built-in testing utilities for backend validation
- Establish CI/CD pipeline with automated testing gates

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach:**
- Continue feature-based module organization (`/src/features/{feature}/`)
- New features: `notifications/`, `search/`, `files/`, `bookmarks/`
- Shared components in `/src/components/` with clear naming conventions
- Convex backend functions in `/convex/{entity}.ts` matching frontend features

**Naming Conventions:**
- React components: PascalCase (`NotificationBadge.tsx`)
- Hooks: `use-{action}-{entity}.ts` (`use-create-notification.ts`)
- Convex functions: `{entity}.{action}` (`notifications.create`, `search.query`)
- Types: PascalCase with descriptive names (`NotificationPreferences`)

**Coding Standards:**
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint + Prettier for code formatting
- Follow existing Convex validator patterns (`v` from `convex/values`)
- Component prop types defined with TypeScript interfaces
- Error handling with try-catch and user-friendly error messages

**Documentation Standards:**
- JSDoc comments for all exported functions and components
- README files for each new feature module
- Update CLAUDE.md with new architecture patterns
- Maintain changelog for all schema and API changes

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration:**
- Next.js build with static optimization where possible
- Convex deployment via `npx convex deploy`
- Environment variables managed through Vercel and Convex dashboard
- Build validation gates: TypeScript compilation, ESLint, unit tests

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Vercel for frontend with automatic preview deployments
- Convex Cloud for backend with separate dev/staging/prod environments
- Feature flags for gradual rollout of new capabilities
- Blue-green deployment pattern for zero-downtime updates

**Monitoring and Logging:**
- Convex built-in logging for backend function execution
- Frontend error tracking with Sentry or similar
- Performance monitoring with Web Vitals and Lighthouse CI
- User analytics for feature adoption and usage patterns

**Configuration Management:**
- Environment-specific configs in `.env.local` (dev) and Vercel dashboard (prod)
- Feature flags stored in Convex database for runtime toggling
- OAuth credentials managed via Convex CLI (`convex env set`)
- Secrets rotation policy and access control documentation

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- **Risk**: Convex query performance degradation with 100k+ messages
  **Mitigation**: Implement pagination, indexes, and search result caching
- **Risk**: File storage costs scaling with user adoption
  **Mitigation**: Set storage limits, implement file retention policies, consider CDN
- **Risk**: Real-time subscription overhead with many concurrent users
  **Mitigation**: Optimize subscription queries, implement connection pooling

**Integration Risks:**
- **Risk**: Breaking existing features when adding new database fields
  **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, gradual schema migrations, feature flags
- **Risk**: Authentication flow conflicts with new SSO requirements
  **Mitigation**: Extend @convex-dev/auth incrementally, maintain existing providers
- **Risk**: UI consistency breaking with new component additions
  **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to shadcn/ui patterns, component library audits

**Deployment Risks:**
- **Risk**: Downtime during Convex schema updates
  **Mitigation**: Use Convex's zero-downtime migration features, staging validation
- **Risk**: Environment config mismatches between dev/prod
  **Mitigation**: Infrastructure as code, automated config validation
- **Risk**: Rollback complexity for multi-component features
  **Mitigation**: Feature flags, database schema versioning, deployment runbooks

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive test coverage before production deployment
- Staged rollout with monitoring and quick rollback procedures
- Regular performance benchmarking and load testing
- Documentation of known issues and workarounds for support team
